Introduction to Adobe After Effects
===================================

Adobe After Effects is a widespread animation and compositing program, or, to put it another way, it's kind of Photoshop for video. If you don't have After Effects yet, or need more information about this product, you can check its dedicated page on `Adobe.com<http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html>`_ and download a 30 day trial version.

Why After Effects?
------------------

Animating and compositing graphical designs using XML is time consuming, excessively complicated, and ultimately not rewarding. Not to mention that motion designers or graphic artists simply don't code to make things move. As we were looking for a design environment for our templates, we decided After Effects will be our weapon of choice. Widespread acceptation in the motion design world, ability to script it and convert projects to XML sealed the deal for us.

On top of that, After Effects has a great community, and a sweet learning curve.

What versions are supported?
---------------------------

We are internally using Adobe After Effects CS6, but we accepts projects from CS5 to CS6.

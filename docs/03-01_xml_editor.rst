Using the Stupeflix XML Editor
==============================

The XML Editor is our home to test your XML definitions. An XML definition is usually a list of widgets, may they be from an After Effects project or a build-in Widget, and a list of assets to fill the placeholders.

If you've designed a video ad campaign, your XML definition will mainly be an ordered Widget succession.

But we can do much more. We use the XML definition to create stacks of widgets, sequences of Widgets, stacked sequences (yes, you can do both, bi-winning style !) transitions, and add audio.

As you see, there is much you can do with Widgets, but that's not all, we can even toy with the widgets themselves !

You can apply effects on the assets, modify the way they behave inside the placeholders, and even modify (show, hide, change color or opacity) layers from your After Effects Widget.

This ability to change build, combine, and modify behaviors directly inside the XML definition should be taken into account when you are designing your After Effects Widgets.

Not only we can reorder our bricks (to get back on that Lego bandwagon), but we can also change some paint to !

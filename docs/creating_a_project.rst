Creating a Project
==================

Placeholder and Tagging
-----------------------

As After Effects was not designed to have dynamic content generated from an external source, we need to specify in the project where the user content will be. We have 2 types of content, graphical content such as maps, pictures and videos, and text content. Both are tagged the same way, but are handled slightly differently.
